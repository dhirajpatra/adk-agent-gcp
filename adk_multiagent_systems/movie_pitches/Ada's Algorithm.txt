**Logline:**
A brilliant 19th-century mathematician, stifled by societal expectations and the shadow of her notorious father, defies a male-dominated world to envision a future where machines can do more than just calculate, becoming the world's first computer programmer.

**Three-Act Plot Outline:**

**Act 1: The Burden of Genius**
*   **Introduction to Ada:** We meet young Ada Lovelace, a child prodigy with an extraordinary mathematical mind, constantly navigating the complex legacy of her famous father, Lord Byron. Her mother, Anne Isabella Milbanke, rigorously pushes her towards science and logic to suppress any "poetic madness" inherited from Byron.
*   **Early Struggles and Fascination:** Despite frequent childhood illnesses and the restrictive societal expectations for women of her era, Ada's curiosity for mechanics and logic blossoms. She devours books and experiments with inventions.
*   **The Inciting Incident:** Ada attends a soirée where she meets the eccentric inventor Charles Babbage and is immediately captivated by his Analytical Engine. She sees beyond its mechanical gears, glimpsing a profound potential that even Babbage himself hasn't fully grasped.

**Act 2: The Poetical Scientist**
*   **Collaboration and Breakthrough:** Ada begins a deep intellectual collaboration with Babbage, initially translating Luigi Menabrea's article on the Analytical Engine. However, her "Notes" quickly expand beyond mere translation, becoming a groundbreaking work where she articulates her vision of the machine's capacity for symbolic manipulation, music, and art – a concept she terms "poetical science."
*   **Intellectual Battles and Personal Sacrifices:** Ada faces skepticism from the scientific community and struggles to balance her intense intellectual pursuits with her domestic duties and the expectations placed upon a woman of her station. She champions her unique blend of imagination and rigorous logic, often clashing with Babbage's more pragmatic, number-focused view.
*   **The First Program:** Despite Babbage's ongoing financial difficulties and the machine's incomplete status, Ada completes her revolutionary "Notes," including the detailed algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers, which is widely recognized as the world's first computer program. This marks a moment of profound intellectual triumph and a testament to her visionary insight.

**Act 3: A Legacy Unseen**
*   **Unrecognized Genius:** Ada struggles to gain widespread recognition and understanding for her radical ideas in a world not yet ready for them. Her health begins to deteriorate, adding a tragic urgency to her efforts to articulate her vision.
*   **The Unbuilt Dream:** The Analytical Engine remains largely unbuilt in her lifetime, and her groundbreaking contributions are largely overlooked by her contemporaries, who fail to grasp the magnitude of her foresight.
*   **Enduring Vision:** Despite the lack of immediate impact and her declining health, Ada maintains an unwavering belief in the future potential of her "poetical science" and the machines she envisioned. The film concludes with a poignant reflection on her enduring legacy, perhaps a montage or narration that hints at how her ideas would eventually be rediscovered and form the foundational principles of modern computing, solidifying her place as a true pioneer ahead of her time.
