Logline: A brilliant 19th-century mathematician, burdened by her poetic father's legacy and societal constraints, defies expectations to envision a revolutionary machine capable of more than mere numbers, becoming the world's first computer programmer and forever changing the course of technology.

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act I: The Poet's Daughter and the Calculating Machine
Ada Byron, a young woman of extraordinary intellect and the only legitimate daughter of the infamous Lord Byron, is raised by her mathematics-obsessed mother, Lady Byron, who seeks to suppress any poetic tendencies. Despite her mother's efforts, Ada possesses a unique blend of analytical rigor and imaginative insight, which she calls "poetical science." She struggles with the rigid expectations placed upon women of her era, who are largely confined to domestic roles. Her world changes when she is introduced to the eccentric inventor Charles Babbage and his fantastical Analytical Engine, a mechanical device designed for complex calculations. Ada is immediately captivated, seeing beyond its current limitations, and a mentorship begins, much to the skepticism of Babbage's male peers and the concern of her mother.

Act II: The Visionary and the Engine's Potential
Ada immerses herself in Babbage's work, quickly becoming his most astute collaborator. While Babbage focuses on the machine's capacity for pure calculation, Ada's "poetical science" allows her to envision its true potential: a machine that could manipulate symbols, create music, and process information far beyond arithmetic. She begins translating Luigi Menabrea's article on the Analytical Engine, but her accompanying notes become her magnum opus – a detailed explanation of how the machine could execute a sequence of operations to calculate Bernoulli numbers, effectively creating what is now considered the first computer program. This period is marked by intense intellectual breakthroughs, but also by personal challenges, including her delicate health, the pressures of motherhood, and the struggle to gain recognition for her radical ideas in a male-dominated scientific world. Babbage, initially resistant to her broader vision, slowly comes to appreciate her profound insights.

Act III: The Legacy of a Digital Dreamer
Despite her groundbreaking work, the Analytical Engine remains unbuilt due to lack of funding and Babbage's perfectionism. Ada faces increasing health issues, but her determination to articulate her vision never wanes. Her published notes, though initially met with limited understanding, plant the seeds for future technological advancements. She continues to advocate for the machine's potential, even as her own life draws to a close. The film concludes with a reflection on Ada's enduring legacy, showing how her "poetical science" and her visionary understanding of computing laid the theoretical groundwork for the digital age, long before the technology existed to realize her dreams. Her work, once overlooked, is finally recognized as the foundational text of computer programming, cementing her place as a true pioneer.
